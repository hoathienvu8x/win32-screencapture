win32-screencapture
===================

A simple program to capture the screen using Windows API.
Just a demonstration of how you can capture screen contents and how you can play with
windows API. Of course there're a bunch of good ways of doing the same thing, so don't
blame me about the awkward method I've used 3 years ago.

How to use
===================
1. Launch the program.
2. Left Click on a random position on the screen.
3. Left Click on another random position on the screen.
4. Right Click anywhere on the new window just came out.
5. The screenshot of the new window will be saved in the same place with the program.


TODO list
===================
1. Add Unit Test.
2. Fix bugs.
